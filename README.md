# RustVsPython in Machine Learning: A Performance Comparison
![Alt text](https://github.com/refedico/RustVsPython/blob/main/rustvspython.png)

This repository aims to compare the performance of Python and Rust in the field of Machine Learning (ML). As Python has been the go-to language for ML due to its extensive libraries and ease of use, Rust is emerging as a powerful alternative, offering potential advantages in performance and memory safety.

### Contents
    - Benchmark Tests: A series of benchmarks to measure the performance of Python and Rust in various ML tasks.
    - Sample Projects: Implementations of common ML algorithms in both Python and Rust, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
    - Performance Analysis: Detailed analysis and comparison of execution times, memory usage, and scalability between the two languages.

### ML algorithms implemented
    - Linear Regression
    - Clustering: K-means
    - DecisionTree
    - MLP Neural Networks
